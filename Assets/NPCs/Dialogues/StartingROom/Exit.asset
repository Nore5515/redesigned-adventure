  - Heh. Little statue guys I made.
  - I build entrances like this all the time in games. Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress,
    etc.
  - Wanted to see what it looked like from my little guy's perspective.
  - ...not too bad? The entrance idea seemed cooled in my head.
  - The statue of the guy was fun to make in blender.
